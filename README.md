# ALU-Design
1.4-bit ALU: The code defines a basic 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
2.Operations: It performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and bitwise logic (AND, OR, NOT).
3.Control: A 3-bit input ($\mathbf{Op}$) selects which of the operations to execute.
4.Combinational: The ALU is a combinational circuit (output changes immediately when inputs change).
5.Verification: A small testbench ($\mathbf{TB}$) is included to apply inputs and test the ALU's functionality.
